# Star Splob
A sideways scrolling space shooter, written in Python & PyGame

*This is a work in progress!*

## Features
- Vertical movement wraps around, so if you move off the bottom of the screen you will appear at the top
- Movement is govened by separate x and y velocities
- Acceleration and deceleration follow a sine curve
- Randomly generated star field used to show movement in the horizontal

## Requirements

You will need to install Python 3 (3.9 used for development) and pygame 2.
